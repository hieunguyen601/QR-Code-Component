What I Learned
While building this component, I gained more experience with:

Centering elements with flexbox

Creating card-style components using border-radius and box-shadow

Organizing clean and simple HTML/CSS structure

Applying a background gradient to the full viewport

Here’s a small CSS example from the project:

css
Copy
Edit
body {
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  background-image: linear-gradient(rgb(165, 128, 61), black);
}
Continued Development
In the future, I’d like to:

Add media queries for better responsiveness on all screen sizes

Experiment with more advanced animations or hover effects

Explore CSS Grid as another layout option
